        <h1>GAME PLAY GUIDELINES</h1>

    <p>Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. Since you don’t have to move
        around the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without
        pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be
        really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.</p>
    <p>Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.</p>

        <p>Participants in Slammers Beach Volleyball play at their own risk. Anyone playing is responsible for their own
            safety and should only play if they are capable. Check with your doctor before you begin. Game fees must be
            paid prior to the start of the game. Games may be cancelled by players up to 4 hours before hand to get
            a refund. Without 4 hours' notice, participants will forfeit the game and be charged 50% of the game fee.</p>

    <p>Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.</p>
        <p>I have read the above and agree to the guidelines set by Slammers Volleyball.</p><br>
